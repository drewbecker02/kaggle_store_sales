# Kaggle Store Sales Forecasting Competition 

This notebook contains code for running Random Forest on Kaggle's store sales competition data. I utilize machine learning and time-series analysis to predict store sales across 54 grocery stores and 33 families of items. The code in the notebook placed in the top 10% of over 3000 submissions on kaggle.com at the time of the submission (May 2023). 

## NOTE
This notebook is for display, and cannot be run without access to the Kaggle dataset. If you enter the competition, you can access the data and run the notebook for yourself. The competition is located here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview
